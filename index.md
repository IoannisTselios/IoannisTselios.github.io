## San Francisco's Fight Against Street Crime: A 15-Year heatmap Overview
San Francisco has been tackling the issues of prostitution and human trafficking for a long time. Between 2003 and 2018, two areas were particularly noted for these activities: the Mission District and the Tenderloin, which stretches up to parts of Nob Hill. Initially, according to the heatmap the Tenderloin and Nob Hill were more notorious, but by 2010, the Mission District saw a significant rise in such crimes.

In 2011, San Francisco's police strategy shifted. They began focusing on making a lot of arrests, especially around the Nob Hill neighborhood, aiming to clean up the streets. However, this move sparked debate. Critics argued that arresting those involved in prostitution wasn't the best way to help victims of trafficking. They worried that this approach might just push the problem into different neighborhoods, making it harder to offer support to those in need.

The crime map showed that as the police increased arrests, the incidents in Nob Hill began to decrease. But then, a new trend emerged: the activities seemed to move towards Union Square, alongside the continued high rate of crimes in the Mission District up until 2014. After that, there was a noticeable improvement in the Mission District, suggesting that newer programs aimed at helping victims or changes in police methods were starting to make a difference.
