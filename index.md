# Prostitution in San Fransico Through Space and Time

In 2016, California stood out among all U.S. states for having the highest number of arrests related to prostitution, as reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in "Crime in the United States 2016". The city of San Francisco, the period from 2003 to 2018 witnessed significant fluctuations in prostitution-related crimes, including solicitation, lewd conduct, operating houses of prostitution, pandering, and human trafficking. While not all variations in crime rates can be directly linked to identifiable causes, a notable trend is the overall decline in prostitution crimes post-2008, up until 2016, when such crimes nearly doubled.

Interestingly, the distribution of crime counts by San Francisco districts does not consistently align with this overall trend. For instance, although the Mission district typically records the highest crime counts, this was not the case in 2004, 2005, 2014, 2015, and 2016. During 2004 and 2005, the Northern District saw more criminal activity, ranking it first. In 2014, the Central District became the recorded the maximum occurences of such crimes, while in 2015 and 2016, such activity shifted to the Southern District, which had previously experienced very low crime rates. By 2017, the Mission District once again emerged as the area with the most reported crimes. The Central District generally mirrors the broader declining crime trend from 2008 to 2012, with slight increases in 2013, and notable spikes in 2014 (as mentioned before) and 2017. It is interesting to note that before this steady decline, in 2007, Central was the second most prostiitution ridden area of San Francisco.

Another interesting observation is the surge in prostitution-related crimes in the Taraval District after 2015, seemingly without precedent. Conversely, the Tenderloin District, traditionally known for high levels of criminal activity, saw a significant decrease in crime rates post-2010 with its prostitution crime rate being negligible from 2014 onwards, with no subsequent recovery.

These patterns suggest that different police strategies or external factors might either effectively reduce criminal activity in certain areas, as observed in the Tenderloin District post-2014 or simply cause the migration of prostitution activities from one district to another, illustrated by the shifting crime scenes among the Mission, Central, Southern, and Taraval Districts in 2014-2017.

## San Francisco's Fight Against Street Crime: A 15-Year heatmap Overview
San Francisco has been tackling the issues of prostitution and human trafficking for a long time. As also seen above, between 2003 and 2018, two areas were particularly noted for these activities: the Mission District and the Tenderloin, which stretches up to parts of Nob Hill. Initially, according to the heatmap the Tenderloin and Nob Hill were more notorious, but by 2010, the Mission District saw a significant rise in such crimes.

In 2011, San Francisco's police strategy shifted. They began focusing on making a lot of arrests, especially around the Nob Hill neighborhood, aiming to clean up the streets. However, this move sparked debate. Critics argued that arresting those involved in prostitution wasn't the best way to help victims of trafficking. They worried that this approach might just push the problem into different neighborhoods, making it harder to offer support to those in need.

The crime map showed that as the police increased arrests, the incidents in Nob Hill began to decrease. But then, a new trend emerged: the activities seemed to move towards Union Square, alongside the continued high rate of crimes in the Mission District up until 2014. After that, there was a noticeable improvement in the Mission District, suggesting that newer programs aimed at helping victims or changes in police methods were starting to make a difference.
