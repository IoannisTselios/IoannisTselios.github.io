# Prostitution in San Fransico Through Space and Time

In 2016, California stood out among all U.S. states for having the highest number of arrests related to prostitution, as reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in "Crime in the United States 2016". The city of San Francisco, the period from 2003 to 2018 witnessed significant fluctuations in prostitution-related crimes, including solicitation, lewd conduct, operating houses of prostitution, pandering, and human trafficking. While not all variations in crime rates can be directly linked to identifiable causes, a notable trend is the overall decline in prostitution crimes post-2008, up until 2016, when such crimes nearly doubled.

Interestingly, the distribution of crime counts by San Francisco districts does not consistently align with this overall trend. For instance, although the Mission district typically records the highest crime counts, this was not the case in 2004, 2005, 2014, 2015, and 2016. During 2004 and 2005, the Northern District saw more criminal activity, ranking it first. In 2014, the Central District became the recorded the maximum occurences of such crimes, while in 2015 and 2016, such activity shifted to the Southern District, which had previously experienced very low crime rates. By 2017, the Mission District once again emerged as the area with the most reported crimes. The Central District generally mirrors the broader declining crime trend from 2008 to 2012, with slight increases in 2013, and notable spikes in 2014 (as mentioned before) and 2017. It is interesting to note that before this steady decline, in 2007, Central was the second most prostiitution ridden area of San Francisco.

Another interesting observation is the surge in prostitution-related crimes in the Taraval District after 2015, seemingly without precedent. Conversely, the Tenderloin District, traditionally known for high levels of criminal activity, saw a significant decrease in crime rates post-2010 with its prostitution crime rate being negligible from 2014 onwards, with no subsequent recovery.

These patterns suggest that different police strategies or external factors might either effectively reduce criminal activity in certain areas, as observed in the Tenderloin District post-2014 or simply cause the migration of prostitution activities from one district to another, illustrated by the shifting crime scenes among the Mission, Central, Southern, and Taraval Districts in 2014-2017.

## San Francisco's Fight Against Street Crime: A 15-Year heatmap Overview

San Francisco has been tackling the issues of prostitution and human trafficking for a long time. As also seen above, between 2003 and 2018, two areas were particularly noted for these activities: the Mission District and the Northern district, which stretches up to parts of Central and Tenderloin district. Initially, as indicated by the heatmap and the bar chart above, these districts recorded higher instances of crime. However, by 2008 there was a noticeable downward trend in the overall number of crimes.

Around 2010, San Francisco's police strategy shifted. They began focusing on making a lot of arrests, especially around the Northern neighborhood, aiming to clean up the streets, which it is clear seen on the bar chart and also on the heatmap. From 2010 to 2013, the Northern District was the site of 30% of the reported prostitution-related crimes in San Francisco. However, this move sparked debate. Critics argued that arresting those involved in prostitution wasn't the best way to help victims of trafficking. They worried that this approach might just push the problem into different neighborhoods, making it harder to offer support to those in need.

The crime map indicated that while police ramped up arrests in specific districts, the number of incidents in the Northern District started to decline.  However, around 2016, a shift in activity was observed: Crime began to rise in Union Square, located in the Southern District, while the Mission District continued to experience a high crime rate until 2014. After that, there was a noticeable improvement in the Mission District, suggesting that newer programs aimed at helping victims or changes in police methods were starting to make a difference.

## Evolving Strategies in San Francisco's Battle Against Prostitution

One notable initiative was the First Offender Prostitution Program (FOPP), also known by the term of "john school." This program targets reducing solicitations for prostitution by focusing on education rather than punishment to reduce recidivism among those who solicit prostitutes. Recognizing the diverse backgrounds and motivations of those soliciting prostitutes, FOPP aims to educate "johns", men arrested for soliciting prostitutes, about the consequences of their actions and the risks associated with soliciting prostitution. First-time offenders, upon paying a fee and completing a day-long workshop, could have their charges dismissed provided they weren't rearrested for similar offenses within the following year.

The majority of recorded prostitution offenses in San Francisco are tied to solicitation or brothel visits, so the data shown in the figure bellow indicates a downward trend in prostitution related crimes over time. Analysis of the different categories of prostitution offenses reveals a fluctuating but overall decreasing tendency in count, particularly in "Soliciting for prostitution," "Soliciting to visit a brothel," and "Loitering for prostitution." This suggests the First Offender Prostitution Program's potential impact on reducing repeat offenses, although it's challenging to definitively attribute the overall decrease in prostitution-related crimes to this program alone.

However, a detailed examination across different offense categories reveals an alarming increase in human trafficking incidents, especially in the years 2013 to 2017. This rise could either indicate a growing prevalence of such crimes or reflect a more rigorous enforcement effort by the authorities. The distinction between these possibilities remains unclear, underscoring the complexity of addressing prostitution-related crimes comprehensively.

San Francisco's battle against prostitution and human trafficking reflects a complex landscape of strategies and outcomes. While initiatives like the First Offender Prostitution Program aim to reduce recidivism through education, the shifting patterns of crime across the city's districts and the rise in human trafficking incidents present ongoing challenges. These trends invite further reflection on the effectiveness of current approaches and underscore the need for adaptable, multifaceted strategies to address the deep-rooted issues within San Francisco's changing socio-legal environment.
